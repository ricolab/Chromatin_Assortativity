# Chromatin_Assortativity

Code to calculate chromatin assortativity (ChAs) of epigenomic fetaures in chromatin interaction networks, including the ChIP-seq features and promoter-capture HiC (PCHIC) used in Pancaldi et al, 2016 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-1003-3)

This GitHub repository contains an updated version of original code used in the paper that is available in FigShare (https://figshare.com/articles/ChromatinAssortativity/2009232/7).
